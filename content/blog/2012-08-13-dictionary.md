There's this game my family plays, either alone or with other families, and it's called dictionary. I'm not convinced that my dad didn't just make that name up.

**Description**
The players (four or more) find a dictionary, slips of paper, and enough pens so that each person has one. The starting person flips through the dictionary until he finds a word that he likes, and makes sure that nobody in the group knows what the word means. The other players copy this down.

The players without the dictionary try and make up the most convincing definition for the word, while the first player writes down the actual definition.

Everybody folds the slips of paper, and hands them to the player with the dictionary, who then proceeds to read all of them (including the real definition) aloud.

The non-dictionary players vote on what seems to be the realest-sounding definition.

The scores are then tallied up, and the dictionary passed to the next player. Repeat until everybody has had a turn. This comprises one round.

**Scoring**
Every player who guesses the right definition gets a point.
Every player whose definition got voted on gets the same amount of points as votes.
If the dictionary holding player's real definition got no votes, he receives a point.
