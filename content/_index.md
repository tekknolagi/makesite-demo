<!-- title: Max Bernstein -->

# I'm Max Bernstein.

I am a human and [programmer](https://github.com/tekknolagi). I like to read
books, take photos and ride bikes in the hills near my house. I work at
Instagram as a software engineer.

You can [email me](mailto:contact@bernsteinbear.com) if you so desire.  I'm
happy to talk about education, programming languages, cycling, and more.

## I like making things.

That's probably an understatement. Here are some of my favorite projects:

* An in-progress [Lisp to x86-64
  compiler](https://github.com/tekknolagi/ghuloum) I'm writing in C
* [EXP 57](/excollege/), a course on professional and personal development that
  I taught at Tufts University with [Yuki](https://yzan424.github.io/)
* The [term paper](/dat-paper/) I wrote for COMP 117 IDS analyzing Dat and the
  Beaker browser
* [Reason](https://facebook.github.io/reason/), a compiler front-end and
  toolchain for OCaml
* An [automatically distributed programming
  language](https://github.com/tekknolagi/distlisp) (2016) for my
  networks course, with the [final writeup \[PDF\]](/resources/comp112-writeup.pdf)
* The [final project spec
  \[PDF\]](/resources/comp15-homework6.pdf) and reference implementation (2016)
  and [independent project spec \[PDF\]](/resources/comp15-independent.pdf)
  (2016) for the data structures course I TA'd
* A [distributed ray tracer](https://github.com/TheiaRT/tracer) (2015)
  that I made with friends for a concurrent programming course, with
  the [final writeup \[PDF\]](/resources/comp50-writeup.pdf)
* A probably bug-ridden [C sockets
  library](https://github.com/tekknolagi/ssock) (2014) that I made for
  [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com), along with
  the much cleaner [C++ sockets library](https://github.com/TheiaRT/libiris)
  (2015) that I made for the distributed ray tracer
* An unexpectedly popular [virtual machine](https://github.com/tekknolagi/carp)
  (2014) that got some Hacker News attention, along with its newer and much
  better designed [cousin](https://github.com/RabbitVM/rabbit) (2016)

Many other class projects, while delightful, cannot be published due to
university policy.

## I kind of maintain a blog.

<del>It's not very interesting just yet.</del> [Things are happening.](/blog/)

## Sometimes I contribute to open source projects.

* [Reason](https://github.com/facebook/reason)
* [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)
  ([rC345558](https://reviews.llvm.org/rC345558))
* [Pyre](https://pyre-check.org/) ([Refactor protocol inference](https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check/commit/f14577db5940c0b4087fffe209786cd4075f37df))
* [CPython](https://www.python.org/)
  ([bpo-36929](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/13392),
  [bpo-38648](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/17002))
